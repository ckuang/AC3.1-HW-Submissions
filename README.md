### Instructions

1. Fork this repo into your own github
2. Create a new branch in your forked repo. Use your name as the new branch name. (e.g git checkout -b Xiangbing)
3. Under your branch, create a folder. Use your name as the name for the folder.
4. Each time you do your homework, please create a separate folder under the folder created in step 3 and put all your files inside that folder. Use the time and the category of the assignment as the name of your folder. (e.g  08/08 pair programming, week3 weekly project)
4. Make a pull request from the newbranch in your repo to the master branch in our main repo when you are ready to submit your homework.
5. If you want to update your submission, just push your changes to your own forked repo, the pull request will be automatically updated. You don't need to make another pull request!
6. The grader can see the time of your pull request, if you submit it late, the grader will know it. Also, the grader will ignore all new pull requests after the deadline. Thus, please make sure you submit your homework on time!
7. Also, make sure your code can run! We don't like code having a lot of errors! Otherwise you wouldn't get a good grade!
